You will want to login to your email account, the one you signed up with! Once done, please now wait for an email from us! This will take **roughly** around ~11 minutes to complete if the purchase was successful. If you have not received an email check your spam folder first, and if nothing open a [support ticket](https://billing.lyhmehosting.com/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=1) and we can get it investigated!
