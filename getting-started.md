# Getting Started

Are you wanting to get started on setting up your server? Let's get started!

### Purchased a Server

Nice work navigating that!

Your server will now begin to be setup, please wait for an email from us! This will **roughly** take around ~11 minutes to complete if the purchase was successful. If you have not received an email from us check your spam folder, and if nothing open a [support ticket](https://billing.lyhmehosting.com/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=1) and we can get this investigated!

> Why does it take so long?   
> Our system automatically downloads the latest version of the game, along with other things.

Once you receive the email, it will contain the username, password, and your server details.
